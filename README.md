The TL:DW of it is this:

* Olrox is a vampire, in Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.
* Much like how Alucard is to Dracula, Olrox too might have a son and also be named after the father, just reversed, hence Xorlo.
* Xorlo might have actually been in the game this ENTIRE TIME, trapped in a mangled form due to magic, alchemy. and perhaps shame or regret.
* Xorlo was trapped in a familiar card just waiting to be summoned and brought back from the Astral Plane

## How to use this extension?
Once enabled, just click around the screen. If you hover over the left side of the screen, you should see the volume controls for how loud you want Xorlo to be. Other than that, just click and swing Xorlo around.

## What are some planned updates?
* A "evolution" timer with a cooldown
  * Every few minutes, Xorlo levels up to their alterate advanced form for a short while before reverting back.
* Better swinging animations. 
  * It's all done in Javascript and HTML/CSS
* If the interest is there, expanding to other familars or other games might be nice.
